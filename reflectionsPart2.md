# CareerScaping Part 2
## Preparing for Change

### **Reflection**
Think of a time in your life when you made a significant change successfully—one that you would be happy to share.

## Mission Geospatial: A Journey of Change

In the spring of 2005, I made the bold decision to resign from a company where I had worked for a decade to start my own business. Mission Geospatial operated until 2020, at which point it was put on hiatus.

### **Why Did I Resign?**

After ten years with the company, I had reached a ceiling. Despite earning two professional designations, managing large-scale contracts, and serving as the senior client representative for one of the company’s most significant clients, there were few incentives for advancement.

The company, with over 100 employees, was led by eight founding partners—some nearing retirement. In an effort to provide exit strategies and improve retention, they introduced an employee shareholders group, allowing staff to participate. While I supported this initiative, I felt that eligibility evaluations were arbitrary and lacked merit-based criteria. Many employees shared similar concerns, and within weeks, a dozen staff members from the Calgary office resigned.

For me, the decision was driven by a combination of frustration over limited growth potential and, admittedly, personal ambition. The final straw was a senior manager’s remark: *“You’ve reached the level of your incompetence.”* That statement stuck with me—and fueled my determination.

### **What Happened Next?**

In the spring of 2005, two colleagues and I partnered with other professionals to establish Eclipse Engineering and Geomatics. Instead of joining as an individual, I launched Mission Geospatial, which became a partner in Eclipse. I was responsible for leading the resource services department, primarily focusing on surveying and geomatics in Alberta’s Lower Athabasca Region.

However, within a year, it became evident that the blend of resource and municipal services wasn’t working. As a result, I decided to take Mission Geospatial independent and operate it as a land surveying corporation.

### **Building from the Ground Up**

The transition was intense. Within a week, we had set up operations, hired staff, and began implementing our health and safety program. Leveraging strong client relationships, we prioritized responsiveness and negotiated favorable terms with vendors, ensuring strong cash flow management.

### **The Rocket Ship Phase**

Demand exceeded our capacity to hire. To meet client needs, we optimized workflows, enabling us to do more with less. It was simultaneously the most exhilarating and stressful period of my career.

### **What’s Next for Mission Geospatial?**

Mission’s hiatus has lasted longer than expected, largely due to a series of unforeseen “black swan” events. In fact, I now believe that black swan events are more the rule than the exception.

However, I feel the time is right for a *reimagining* of Mission Geospatial—one that moves beyond a time-and-materials service model. The next phase will focus on delivering value in **fundamentally different** ways.
