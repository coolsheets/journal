# CareerScaping Part 2
## Preparing for Change

<b>REFLECTION</b>

Think of a time in your life when you have made significant change successfully that you would be happy to talk about.

## Mission Geospatial

In the spring of 2005, I resigned from a company after a decade to start my own company.  Mission Geospatial was active until 2020, at which time it was put into hiatus.

### Why did I resign?

After a decade of working within the company I had hit the ceiling and there did not appear to be a way forward.  This was emphasized by the fact that after achieving two professional designations and successfully managing several large-scale contracts, and being the senior client rep for once of the companies most significant clients, there was very little incentive to put forth the effort required to do so.

The company comprised of eight (8) founding partners, some who were nearing retirement.  There were just over 100 staff at that time.  In an effort to provide exit strategies and enhance retention the company decided to create an employee shareholders group, in which all employees were eligible to participate.  This I applauded, however I a felt the evaluations and assignment of eligibility were arbitrary and not based on merit.  There is much more to the story, as there was significant disgruntlement among staff.  I fact, within a few weeks approximately a dozen resigned from the Calgary office.

For myself, there were many issues that contributed to my leaving, most of them were a feeling of lack of potential and to be honest some were ego driven.  The proverbial straw that "broke the camels back" was when another senior manager told me I had "reached the level of my incompetence".  I have never forgotten that statement, it was very motivating.

### What happened?

In the spring of 2005, three of is from the previous company joined with some other professionals to found Eclipse Engineering and Geomatics.  Rather than join as an individual, I founded Mission Geospatial which became a partner in Eclipse.  I was responsible for leading and managing the resource services department with primary focus on surveying and geomatics in the Lower Athabasca Region of Alberta.  The other five founding partners were all focused on municipal development work but would lend resources to the resource department, as they could.

Within a year it became clear the combination of resource and municipal services in this context was not working for various reasons, so I decided to take Mission Geospatial out of Eclipse and run it as a land surveying corporation.

### So then what?

It was a crazy time.  Within a week we had set up shop, hired staff and started to implement our health and safety program.  We had strong client relationships and focused on answering the call.  We negotiated favorable terms from vendors, and focused on strong cash flow management.

### Rocket Ship

Again, it was a crazy time.  We could not hire enough staff to fulfill the needs, but by optimizing solutions were able to do more with less.

It was the most rewarding and most stressful time in my career.

### So what now?

Mission's hiatus has been longer than originally anticipated, a series of black swan events have occurred.  In fact, I'm convinced that black swan events are more the norm than the exception.  However, I feel the time is right for a reimagining of Mission, a reimagining that will pivot the company from a time and materials company to one that brings value in significantly different ways.
