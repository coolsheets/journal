Finally got Unbuntu working on my Lenovo. <mark>Add more ram.</mark>

Tried the markdwon formatting found in Markdown Cheet Sheet in [this folder](markdown.md).  Some of the formatting codes are not GitFriendlyMarkdown (GFM), CoPilot helped out.

Tested Mermain charting in markdown [see example of Gantt chart](gantt.md)
