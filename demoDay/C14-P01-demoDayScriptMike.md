# Project 1 Portfolio Demo Presentation Guide

## Presentation Guide
Total Time: <b>7 minutes, Presentation: 5 minutes | Q&A: 2 minutes</b>
### 1. Introduction - Your Story & Vision (1 minute)
- Chameleon Joke
- My name is Mike, I'm a seasoned professional with many years in high technology space. For the past few decades I have been an senior leader and executive in the consulting industry.  Our space is full of "makers", those who see technological challenges as the part of daily operations, so it is a matter of course to build scripts and light weight "apps" to solve them. However, rarely do those solutions become promulgated and monetized beyond specific project needs.
- As a life-long learner, I often take various coding courses online, usually to solve a specific need, or learn something that intrigues me.
- I was laid-off just before Christmas and was seeking support for legitimate learning and found InceptionU through government websites.
- I neither have the time nor budget to pursue credentialed training, and find the "gold" difficult to find in online training. 
- Taking full-stack training will enable me to see the entire ecosystem, to actualize solutions, democratize data and technology and ultimately disrupt my professional domain.
- I am intrigued by making the impossible possible, my portfolio is a work-in-progress that provides a glimpse of the potential.
### 2. Showcasing the Portfolio (2 minutes)
Walk your audience through your portfolio. Give a quick overview of the structure—how did you design it to represent your skills, personality, and career aspirations? What decisions did you make around layout, branding, and user experience?!

Cover the main components of your tech stack: frontend, backend, and deployment. Explain how these choices fit your goals and what you learned by using them.
Highlight any "spicy" features—things that go beyond the basics. Did you incorporate
animations, an interactive resume, or an API integration? If there’s a particular feature you’re proud of, showcase it.

Then, tie your portfolio to your learning journey. How does it reflect what you've learned? Did your design choices evolve as you gained new skills? What were some of the key “aha” moments that shaped how you built it? If you made deliberate decisions about accessibility, responsiveness, or interactivity, highlight those.Where do you see yourself improving your portfolio?

coding)
